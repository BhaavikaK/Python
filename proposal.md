# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Temple foods

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A mobile app that helps Temple students figure out dining options in campus.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our app will help you to sprcifically search restaurants and food trucks on campus based on if you are a vegetarian, non-vegetarain or vegan. After you pick a choice, it will provide you with a list of dining options available. In addition, it will specify the type of payment each restaurant accepts, diamond dollars, cash/credit or meal plans. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Choiyon Chakraborty, choiyon.chakraborty@temple.edu, TA- Zhenyu Zhao

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

It will give you a list of dining options available based on your pick if you are a vegetarian, non-vegetarian or vegan.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In addition, it will tell you the type of payment each restaurant accepts.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

It will direct you to the restaurants website where you can order food and look at the menu

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
We will work collectively to gather data about the dining places like their names, and the payment type that they accept. We will need  alot of if/ else statements, so we need to practice that and also lists. We need skills to learn how to do animation and graphics for the app.
